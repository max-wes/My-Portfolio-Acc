        <h3>movie</h3>        
        <p>One of the latest robot movies making waves is "Subservience" on Netflix.
             Released in September 2024, it stars Megan Fox as an AI robot. The movie starts off 
             with the robot being sweet and helpful to a family with a sick mother, but things take a dark
            turn when it gains sentience and becomes a bit hostile1. The film has received mixed reviews, with a 50%
            critics rating and a 48% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><br>
             <p>Another exciting robot movie to check out is "The Wild Robot". Released in September 2024, this film is 
                an adaptation of Peter Brown's beloved novel1. It follows the journey of a robot named Roz, who is shipwrecked 
                on an uninhabited island. To survive, Roz forms bonds with the island's animals and becomes the adoptive parent 
                of an orphaned gosling1.

                The movie features the voices of Lupita Nyong'o as Roz, Pedro Pascal as Fink the fox, 
                and Kit Connor as Brightbill the gosling. It's a heartwarming story about survival, 
                adaptation, and the connections between technology and nature1.
